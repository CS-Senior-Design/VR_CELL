## Endomembrane System

Welcome to VR Cell! In this virtual reality experience, you will explore the inner workings of a human cell via the endomembrane system. In this lab, you can take the cell tour to see how all the pieces interact, or play with the cell and read what each organelle does on your own. Would you like to take the tour?

Welcome to the Cell Tour! Whenever you are ready, press the start button below to begin.


> Begin

We begin our tour in the cytoplasm, the space in-between the nucleus and the cell membrane. All of the cell's components that are not in the nucleus reside here, suspended in fluid called cytosol. The endomembrane system consists of all the cell's components that are divided by membranes into specialized functional units called organelles. Over the course of the tour, we will be creating proteins that will be shipped outside of the cell.

Our first stop on the tour of these organelles is the nucleus. The nucleus is the largest and most conspicuous organelle distinguishable in an animal cell. It contains almost all of the cell's DNA, with which it can create ribosomes and proteins needed for cell function. It is enclosed within the nuclear envelope, a double membrane, with each membrane composed of a lipid bilayer. Scattered along the surface of the nucleus are nuclear pores, complexes of proteins that regulate what can go in and out of the nucleus. 

Your first task is to create a ribosome, which is the component responsible for reading genetic information in the form of mRNA and piecing together the protein that it codes for. Collect a protein that will be used to create the ribosomal subunits.

> Collect protein

Within the nucleus, DNA is wrapped into discrete units called chromosomes. Each chromosome is composed of one long DNA molecule and proteins that assist in coiling, expressing or repressing certain areas that individual cells need for their function or stage in life. Such a complex of proteins and DNA is called the chromatin. Additionally within the nucleus resides a large structure called the nucleolus, where rRNA and a bunch of proteins are arranged to form two different sizes of subunits that make up a complete ribosome. Take the protein you grabbed earlier and feed it into the nuceolus to form the ribosome subunits.

> Fuse protein with nucleolus and obtain 60S and 40S subunits

As we make our way outside of the nucleus, notice the largest network of membranes in the cell, the endoplasmic reticulum. It is comprised of two distinct, yet connected regions that differ in function: the rough and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is called so because it is covered on the outside in ribosomes, lending a "rough" appearance. Its membrane, which separates the inside of the ER- called the ER lumen- with the cytosol, is continuous with the nuclear envelope and is where secretory protein and cell membrane production primarily occurs. The smooth ER's surface lacks ribosomes, and houses enzymes used in the production of lipids vital for organism function, as well as in detoxification of drugs and poisons. 

Combine the two subunits together to form a ribosome.

> Fuse 60S and 40S subunits into ribosome

Great! Now that we have a ribosome, all we need is a strand of mRNA in order to create a protein. Ribosomes that are found floating in the cytosol are called free ribosomes, and those attached to the rough ER and nuclear membrane are called bound ribosomes. Most proteins made by free ribosomes function in the cytosol, while those made by bound ribosomes are usually shipped to other organelles such as lysosomes, or to be exported out of the cell.

Pick up a strand of mRNA and feed it into the ribosome in order to create a protein.

> Combine mRNA with ribosome.

When a ribosome comes into contact with mRNA, it begins the process of protein translation. During translation, mRNA is read by the ribosome and decoded into a specific chain of amino acids, called a polypeptide. Transfer RNA acts like a link between the 3-base-pair codons of the mRNA and the amino acid for which they code. The tRNA is accepted by the small subunit if it matches the codon of the mRNA at that point in the translation, and the large subunit of the ribosome links the amino acid it is carrying to any previous acids in the chain. The ribosome then releases the tRNA and the chain grows until it reaches the end of the sequence, after which the polypeptide is released to fold into its proper shape.

Take the protein created by the ribosome.

> Take glycoprotein

Proteins that are created in the rough ER are shipped via membraned bubbles called transport vesicles from the rough ER to the golgi apparatus. The rough ER buds off from a special region known as the transitional ER to form vesicles that are then carried to their destination along a highway of tubes - called microtubules- via motor proteins.

Microtubules are just one of a number of structures that make up the cytoskeleton, the network of fibers that provide support for the cell and provide the means by which cells and their components move. Microtubules are the highway of the cell, providing the means by which organelles move and get from one part of the cell to the other via motor proteins. They also provide structure to the cell itself, resisting compressing forces to keep the cell from being crushed. Special arrangements of microtubules make up cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. Microfilaments, on the other hand, provide structure by bearing tension to keep the cell from being torn open. They are what allows muscle cells to contract.

Intermediate filaments are named so because they are in-between the sizes of the larger microtubules and the smaller microfilaments. They are more permanent fixtures of cells that provide rigidity and help a cell retain its original shape. This is useful for maintaining the shape of macro structures in an organism, like cartilage, skin, nails, and hair.

The golgi apparatus functions like the postal service of the cell. This organelle, shaped like a stack of pancakes, takes in products from the ER and processes them to ship to other components of the cell. The stacks, called "cisternae", travel from one side of the golgi- the "cis" side- to the other - the "trans" side- modifying their contents as they travel to prepare for delivery to their destination, whether it be another cell component or outside as a secretory protein.

Place the vesicle in the cis side of the Golgi Apparatus.

> Place vesicle w/ glycoprotein at cis side

Upon reaching the trans side of the golgi, the cisternae will break off into vesicles that will be carried to their destination. If the cell is in charge of insulin production, for instance, the completed insulin will be carried from the golgi to the cell membrane where the insulin will be released outside of the cell. Otherwise, various markers placed on the vesicle and around the cell components allow the vesicle to be carried to the appropriate cell component, such as a lysosome.

Last stop! Deliver the final product to an endosome to .

> Combine outgoing vesicle with immature lysosome

The final two membraned organelles are the vacuoles and lysosomes. Vacuoles are membraned organelles that carry out different functions in different kinds of cells. In plant cells, a massive vacuole occupies most of the space of the cell. In animal cells, they can carry food and other enzymes into the cell that are needed. Some protists use them to pump water outside of the cell to maintain equilibrium.

Lysosomes are the clean-up crew of the cell. They carry digestive enzymes that allow the cell to recycle damaged organelles and digest macromolecules into nutrients for the cell to use. To digest the food incoming from vacuoles, lysosomes will fuse with the vacuole, releasing its contents inside to digest whatever is inside. Lysosomes are formed when endosomes-- an organelle associated with the trans Golgi network-- fuse with vesicles containing lysosomal enzymes, in the final part of a system called the endocytic pathway.

> Combine Lysosome with damaged mitochondria

This brings us to the end of the tour! We hope you now have a better idea of the internal workings of the cell. You may now take the After Action Review quiz to test your knowledge of the endomembrane system, or you can continue to explore the different parts of the cell, including those not covered in this tour.

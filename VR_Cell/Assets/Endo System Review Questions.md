"How do transport vesicles integrate into the endomembrane system?"
    - Transports proteins made throughout the endo process

"The endomembrane system involves which organelles?
    - Nucleus, ER, Golgi, Vesicles, Lysosomes

"Most important difference between rough and smooth ER?"
    - Rough has ribosomes, smooth absent of ribosomes

"What modifies and sorts proteins/lipids coming from the ER?"
    - Golgi apparatus

"Smooth or rough: stores calcium ions, detoxifies the cell"
    - Smooth ER

"Smooth or rough: first part of ER outside the nucleus, makes glycoproteins"
    - Rough ER

"Produces rRNA, assembles both subunits of the ribosome together"
    - Nucleolus

"One gene in our DNA codes for"
    - One protein (not ex: nucleus, ribosome, RNA)

"T/F: Organelles are all static and stable"
    - False

"Where would a protein be found **first** if it is to be excreted from the cell?"
    - Golgi apparatus (not ex: lysosome, secretory vesicle)

"Shuttles proteins/lipids around the cell"
    - Transport vesicle

"Ribosomes read"
    - RNA (not ex: DNA, amino acids)

1) "How do transport vesicles integrate into the endomembrane system?"
    - Transports proteins made throughout the endo process

2) "The endomembrane system involves which organelles?
    - Nucleus, ER, Golgi, Vesicles, Lysosomes

3) "Most important difference between rough and smooth ER?"
    - Rough has ribosomes, smooth absent of ribosomes

4) "What modifies and sorts proteins/lipids coming from the ER?"
    - Golgi apparatus

5) "Smooth or rough: stores calcium ions, detoxifies the cell"
    - Smooth ER

6) "Smooth or rough: first part of ER outside the nucleus, makes glycoproteins"
    - Rough ER

7) "Produces rRNA, assembles both subunits of the ribosome together"
    - Nucleolus

8) "One gene in our DNA codes for"
    - One protein (not ex: nucleus, ribosome, RNA)

9) "T/F: Organelles are all static and stable"
    - False

10) "Where would a protein be found **first** if it is to be excreted from the cell?"
    - Golgi apparatus (not ex: lysosome, secretory vesicle)

11) "Shuttles proteins/lipids around the cell"
    - Transport vesicle

12) "Ribosomes read"
    - RNA (not ex: DNA, amino acids)

    sentences:
    - 'Size: ~5 micrometers. The nucleus of the cell is where our journey begins.
      The most prominent organelle of the call, the nucleus contains all the genetic
      information for the organism in the DNA packed inside its nuclear envelope.
      It comprises of two main parts: the nuclear envelope (or nuclear membrane)
      - a bilipid mambrane which surrounds the nucleus and separates its contents
      from the rest of the cell - and the nuclear lamina which supports it structurally.
      Along the nuclear membrane are nuclear pores, responsible for regulating the
      entry and exit of cell materials into and out of the nucleus.'
    - The nucleolus is the largest structure within the nucleus, and its main function
      is to create ribosomes. The nucleolus responds to changes in the call, signaled
      by chemical tags, and alters the rate at which it produces ribosomes to react
      to the metabolic activity and growth rate of the cell. Apart from ribosome
      creation, the nucleolus is also responsible for the formation of certain signal
      recognition particles and has a role in the stress response of the cell.
    - Lining the inside of the nucleus is the nuclear lamina. Composed of intermediate
      filaments and other membrane proteins, its function is to structurally support
      the nucleus. It also regulates DNA replication and cell division.
    - The nucleoplasm is analogous to the cytoplasm of the cell, being comprised
      of the various materials housed within the nuclear envelope, including the
      chromosomes, nucleolus, ribosomes, and proteins used for important functions
      in the nucleus.
    - 'Ribosomes are molecular machines located all throughout the cell that assemble
      proteins from the instructions encoded in mRNA, in a process known as translation.
      Amino acids are carried by tRNA are linked together in an order specified by
      the mRNA. A ribosome is composed of two pieces: the large (60S) and small (40S)
      subunits. The "S" refers to the Svedberg unit, a unit of measurement based
      on a particle''s sedimentation rate. Ribosomes originate in the nucleolus and
      its subunits are created by uniting rRNA and a protein.'
    - Proteins are the building blocks of life. They are molecules which make up
      the various components of cells and perform a wide variety of functions that
      ensure proper cell activity. Proteins are comprised of long chains of amino
      acids, called polypeptides. The order of the amino acids indicate how the protein
      is to be folded, and thus determines its final shape and activity. Proteins
      are created by ribosomes all around the cell from mRNA copied from DNA in the
      nucleus.
    - Glycoproteins are attached to a carbohydrate. It is destined for somewhere
      outside of the cell.
    - Cell mobility generally requires interaction of the cytoskeleton with motor
      proteins. Cytoskeleton elements and motor proteins work together with the plsama
      membrane molecules to allow whole cells to move along fibers outside the cell.
    - Kinesins are a kind of motor protein used to transport things around the cell.
      They move along microtubule filaments in one direction, usually from the center
      of the cell outward toward the outside.
    - Ribonucleic Acid is a single-stranded chain of nucleotides which play a critical
      role in coding and decoding for proteins and the expression of genes. It houses
      genetic information, similar to DNA, but replaces thymind with uracil.
    - Messenger RNA is responsible for the coding of a sequence of a gene. It is
      read by a ribosome in order to synthesize a protein. Messenger RNA is created
      in the nucleus via a process called transcription.
    - Transfer RNA is RNA upon which amino acids are bound in order to interface
      with the ribosome in the synthesis of a protein.
    - Ribosomal RNA is non-coding RNA which makes up the primary component of the
      ribosomes. It is transcribed from rDNA and then combined with ribosomal proteins
      to form the large (60S) and small (40S) subunits. It is the component of the
      ribosome that enables it to translate mRNA into proteins. It makes up about
      80% of cellular RNA.
    - Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Found all around the cytoplasm,
      amino acids are carried by tRNA and catalyzed by ribosomes to create proteins.
      The human body needs 20 different kinds of amino acids; 11 of which it can
      produce itself. The rest of them -- referred to as essential amino acids --
      need to be taken in from the outside, typically via one's diet.
    - The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is named as such because the surface of
      the organelle is covered in ribosomes, which make proteins and feed them into
      the hollow space inside the ER, called the lumen, where they are folded and
      made into longer protein chains to be incorporated into cellular membranes
      or secreted from the cell to be used elsewhere. If these proteins are not to
      stay within the ER, they will be "picked up" by the cell's transport vesicles,
      which are portions of the cell membrane that split off into spheres, to transport
      materials around and out of the cell.
    - The smooth ER has no ribosomes attached to its surface, but is still part of
      the overall endoplasmic reticulum along with the rough ER. The smooth ER's
      functions include carbohydrate and lipid creation, cell detoxification, and
      finally -- and potentially most importantly -- serves as a store for calcium
      ions in muscle cells. The function of calcium ion storage in muscle cells is
      to trigger coordinated contractions of muscle fibers allowing for many cells
      to work together to function as one system rather than merely a conglomerate
      of individual cells. This process of many cells acting together to serve a
      purpose greater than the sum of its parts leads to cell specialization and
      the creation of systems of cells becoming tissues and organs.
    - The vesicle is a simple structure defined by having a lipid bilayer. They form
      naturally during typical cell processes and perform a variety of functions.
      They are involved in the cell's metabolism, transport, and storage mechanisms.
      Vesicles have the ability to fuse with the membranes of other cells and organelles
      to assist in carrying out the roles of the cell. Vesicles are an umbrella term,
      of which other organelles can fall under; vacuoles and lysosomes can also be
      described as vesicles, however most commonly, vesicles are describing transport
      vesicles. These are lipid bilayer structures which can move within the cell
      to help move cell materials like proteins from one part of the cell to another,
      like from the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi Apparatus in the Endomembrane
      System.
    - 'The golgi apparatus acts like the "post office" of the cell! Its main functions
      are to sort, package, and chemically tag the lipids and proteins brought to
      it by the cell''s vesicles so that they end up in the correct place, whether
      inside the cell or outside of it. The golgi can be separated into its two sides;
      the cis face and the trans face. The cis face sits on the side nearest to the
      ER and receives the packages of lipids and proteins being transported from
      the ER by the transport vesicles. Once inside the golgi, these proteins undergo
      further modification and have phosphate groups added as tags to be used later
      in order to decide where each proteins should end up. Finally, using these
      chemical tags, the modified proteins and lipids are sorted and packaged into
      another transport vesicle from the trans face of the golgi to be delivered
      to other parts of the cell such as the lysosomes. '
    - The lysosome acts as the cell's "garbage collectors" and works to break down
      old and unnecessary cell materials so that they can be repurposed by the cell
      and used again. These acidic organelles use digestive hydolytic enzymes which
      break down large molecules such as complex proteins and carbohydrates into
      smaller molecules like basic amino acids and simple sugars. In other cases,
      the lysosome may ingest harmful bacteria so that it can be destroyed.
    - Vacuoles are large vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi
      apparatus. Vacuoles are an integral part of a cell's endomembrane system. These
      organelles perform a variety of functions in different kinds of cells. In animal
      cells, vacuoles are small and help get rid of waste products. As food is digested,
      wastes are released when the vacuoles fuse with a specialized region of the
      plasma membrane that functions as an anal pore.
    - The mitochondria are the "powerhouse" of the cell! These organelles are hypothesized
      to have once been a self-sustaining prokaryotic cell which became an endosymbiont
      of the eukaryotic cell that is the animal cell, meaning both the mitochondrion
      and the eukaryotic cell found a mututalistic relationship as a result of the
      mitochondrion becoming part of the cell. Some cell types, such as red blood
      cells, contain no mitochondria while others, like liver cells, can have more
      than 2000! The function of these organelles are to supply the chemical energy
      needed to carry out cell functions, through the processing of adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP); a molecule which energy-dense phosphate groups. These "units" of ATP
      can then be used to power metabolic processes throughout the cell.
    - A peroxisome is an organelle found within the cytoplasm that plays an important
      role in lipid metabolism. Very long chains of fatty acids are broken down via
      beta oxidation into medium chain fatty acids, which are then shipped to the
      mitochondria to be broken down further into carbon dioxide and water.
    - Many of the events of mitosis, which is the process in which a cell duplicates
      all of its contents, depend on the mitotic spindle. In animal cells, the assembly
      of spindle microtubules starts at the centrosome, a subcellular region containing
      material that functions throughout the cell cycle to organize the cell's microtubules
      and is important during cell division. Each centrosome contains two centrioles.
    - In animal cells, microtubules grow out from a centrosome, a region that is
      often located near the nucleus. These microtubules function as compression-resisting
      girders of the cytoskeleton. Within the centrosome is a pair of centrioles,
      each about 250nm in diameter. The two centrioles are at right angles to each
      other, and each is made up of nine sets of three microtubules. The blue portions
      of the centiole shown represent nontubulin proteins that connect the microtubule
      triplets. Centrosomes with centioles help organize microtubule awssembly in
      animal cells.
    - "Microtubules are one of three types of fibers that make up the cytoskeleton.
      They are shaped like hollow tubes and made up of proteins called tubulins.
      A fubulin protein also called a dimer, is made up of two different polypeptides:
      \u03B1-tubulin and \u03B2-tubulin.\nMicrotubules can grow in length by adding
      tubulin dimers, and can also be dis-assembled and their tubulins used elsewhere
      to build other microtubules throughout the cell.\nOverall, their function is
      to serve as the backbone of the cell to help shape and support the cell. They
      also serve as tracks along which organellles equipped with motor proteins can
      move throughout the cell."
    - 'Like microtubules, microfilaments seem to be present in all eukaryotic cells.
      They are thinner, solid rods that play a structural role in bearing tension
      forces (pulling forces) in the cell. In essence, they assist with cell movement
      and are built from molecules of actin -- a globular protein.

      A three-dimensional
      network formed by microfilaments just to the inside of the plasma membrane
      helps support the cell''s shape. This network gives the outer cytoplasmic layer
      of a cell, called the cortex, the semisolid consistency of a gell, in contrast
      with the more fluid state of the interior cytoplasm.'
    - Intermediate filaments are named after their diameter, which is larger than
      that of microfilaments, but smaller than the diameter of microtubules. They
      are made up of proteins called keratins which make them more permanent structures
      than microfilaments and microtubules. Because of their sturdiness, intermediate
      filaments play an important role in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing
      the position of certain organelles. For instance, the nucleus typically sits
      within a cage made of intermediate filaments.
    - "All cells are bounded by a selective barrier, called the plasma membrane --
      or the cell membrane. This barrier is made up of glycerophospholipids; molecules
      composed of glycerol (a phosphate group) and two fatty acid chains. Glycerol
      is a three-carbon molecule that functions as the backbone of these membrane
      lipids. \nThe cell membrane has two functions: first, to be a barrier keeping
      the constituents of the cell in and unwanted substances out. Second, to be
      a \"gate\" allowing the transport of essential nutrients into the cell and
      movement of waste products out of the cell via vacuoles."
    - The area between the cell membrane and the nucleus is referred to as the cytoplasm.
      Often used interchangeably with cytosol, cytoplasm actually refers to all of
      the space within the cell membrane, excluding the nucleus. Thus, all the other
      organelles are also considered part of the cytoplasm.
    - Cytosol, also known as the cytoplasmic matrix, refers to the liquid substance
      upons which the organelles are embedded. In this simulation, it behaves roughly
      like water, but in reality the consistency is more jelly-like.

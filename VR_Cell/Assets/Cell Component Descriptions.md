### Cell Membrane
All cells are bounded by a selective barrier, called the plasma membrane or otherwise known as the **cell membrane**. 

This barrier is made up of glycerophospholipids, molecules composed of glycerol, a phosphate group, and two fatty acid chains. **Glycerol** is a three-carbon molecule that functions as the backbone of these membrane lipids.

The **cell membrane** has two functions: first, to be a barrier keeping the constituents of the cell in and unwanted substances out. Second, to be a gate allowing the transport of essential nutrients into the cell and movement of waste products out of the cell via **vacuoles**.

### Cytoplasm
The area between the cell membrane and the nucleus is referred to as the **cytoplasm**. Often used interchangeably with **cytosol**, cytoplasm actually refers to all of the space within the cell membrane, excluding the nucleus. Thus, all the other organelles are also considered part of the cytoplasm.

### Cytosol
**Cytosol**, also known as the cytoplasmic matrix, refers to the liquid substance upon which the organelles are embedded. In this simulation, it behaves roughly like water, but in reality the consistency is more jelly-like.

## Nucleus
Size: 5 micrometers
The **nucleus** of the cell is where our journey begins. The most prominent organelle in the cell, the nucleus contains all the genetic information for the organism inside DNA packed inside its nuclear envelope. It comprises of two main parts: the nuclear envelope (or nuclear membrane), a bilipid membrane which surrounds the nucleus and separates its contents from the rest of the cell, and the **nuclear lamina** which supports it structurally. Along the nuclear membrane are nuclear pores, responsible for regulating the entry and exit of cell materials into and out of the nucleus.

### Nuclear Lamina
Lining the inside of the nucleus is the **nuclear lamina**. Composed of **intermediate filaments** and other membrane proteins, its function is to structurally support the nucleus. It also regulates DNA replication and cell division.

### Nucleoplasm
The **nucleoplasm** is analogous to the cytoplasm of the cell, being comprised of the various materials housed within the nuclear envelope, including the chromosomes, **nucleolus**, **ribosomes** and **proteins** used for important functions in the nucleus.

### Nucleolus
The **nucleolus** is the largest structure within the nucleus, and its main function is to create **ribosomes**. The nucleolus responds to changes in the cell, signaled by chemical tags, and alters the rate at which it produces ribosomes to react to the metabolic activity and growth rate of the cell. Apart from ribosome creation, the nucleolus is also responsible for the formation of certain **signal recognition particles** and has a role in the **stress response** of the cell.

### Nuclear Pore Complex
A nuclear pore, also known as a nuclear pore complex, is a protein complex that regulates the transport of molecules across the nuclear membrane.

## Ribosome
Ribosomes are molecular machines located all throughout the cell that assemble proteins from the instructions encoded in **mRNA**, a process known as translation. Amino acids carried by tRNA are linked together in an order specified by the mRNA. A ribosome is composed of two pieces: the **large (60S)** and **small (20S) subunits**. The "S" in 60S and 40S refers to the Svedberg unit, a unit of measurement based on a particle's sedimentation rate. Ribosomes originate in the **nucleolus** and its subunits are created by uniting **rRNA** and a protein.

## Proteins
Proteins are the building blocks of life. They are molecules which make up the various components of cells and perform a wide variety of functions that ensure proper cell activity. Proteins are comprised of long chains of **amino acids**, called polypeptides. The order of the amino acids usually indicate how the protein will fold, and thus determine its shape and activity. Proteins are created by **ribosomes** all around the cell from **mRNA** copied from DNA in the nucleus.

### Glycoprotein
This protein is attached to a carbohydrate. It is destined somewhere outside the cell.

### Motor Protein
Cell motility generally requires interaction of the cytoskeleton with **motor proteins**. Cytoskeleton elements and motor proteins work together with the plasma membrane molecules to allow whole cells to move along fibers outside the cell.

Inside the cell, vesicles and other organelles often use motor proteins as "feet" to "walk" to their destinations along microtubules which act as the tracks inside the cell.

An example of a motor protein is called a **dynein** protein. This protein helps in the bending movements of flagella and motile cilia. It uses ATP for energy.

## Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)
Ribonucleic Acid is a single-stranded chain of nucleotides which plays a critical role in coding and decoding for proteins and the expression of genes. It houses genetic information, similar to DNA, but replaces thymine with uracil.

### Messenger RNA (mRNA)
**Messenger RNA** is the coding of a sequence of a gene. It is read by a **ribosome** in order to synthesize a protein. Messenger RNA is created in the nucleus via a process called transcription.

### Transfer RNA (tRNA)
**Transfer RNA** is RNA upon which **amino acids** are bound in order to interface with the ribosome in the synthesis of a protein.

### Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
**Ribosomal RNA** is non-coding **RNA** which makes up the primary component of **ribosomes**. It is transcribed from rDNA and then combined with **ribosomal proteins** to form the **large (60S)** and **small (40S) subunits**. It is the component of the ribosome that enables it to translate **mRNA** into **proteins**. It makes up about 80% of cellular RNA.

### Amino Acid
Amino acids are the building blocks of **proteins**. Found all around the cytoplasm, amino acids are carried by **tRNA** and catalyzed by **ribosomes** to create **proteins**. The human body needs 20 different kinds of amino acids, 11 of which it can produce itself. The rest of them-- referred to as essential amino acids-- need to be taken in from the outside, usually via diet.

### Kinesin
Kinesins are a kind of motor protein used to transport things around the cell. They move along **microtubule** filaments in one direction, usually from the center of the cell towards the outside.

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough)
The **rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** is named as such because the surface of the organelle is covered in ribosomes, which make proteins and feed them into the hollow space inside the ER, called the lumen, where they are **folded and made into longer protein chains** to be incorporated into cellular membranes or secreted from the cell to be used elsewhere. If these proteins are not to stay within the ER, they will be "picked up" by the cell's transport vesicles, which are portions of the cell membrane that split off into spheres to transport materials around and out of the cell.

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (Smooth)
The **smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** has no ribosomes attached to its surface, but is still part of the overall endoplasmic reticulum along with the rough ER. The smooth ER's functions include **carbohydrate and lipid creation**, **cell detoxification**, and finally -- and potentially most importantly -- serves as **a store for calcium ions** in muscle cells. The function of calcium ion storage in muscle cells is to trigger coordinated contractions of muscle fibers allowing for many cells to work together to function as one system rather than a conglomerate of individual cells. This process of many cells acting together to serve a purpose greater than the sum of its parts leads to cell specialization and the creation of systems of cells becoming tissues and organs.

### Vesicle
The **vesicle** is a simple structure defined by having a **lipid bilayer**. They form naturally during typical cell processes and perform a variety of functions. They are involved in the cell's metabolism, transport, and storage mechanisms. Vesicles have the ability to fuse with the membranes of other cells and organelles to assist in carrying out the roles of the cell. Vesicles are an umbrella term, of which other organelles can fall under; **vacuoles** and **lysosomes** can also be described as vesicles, however most commonly, vesicles are describing **transport vesicles**. These are lipid bilayer structures which can move within the cell to help move cell materials like proteins from one part of the cell to another, like from the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi Apparatus in the Endomembrane System.

### Golgi Apparatus
The **golgi apparatus** acts like the "post office" of the cell! Its main functions are to **sort**, **package**, and **chemically tag** the lipids and proteins brought to it by the cell's vesicles so that they end up in the correct place, whether inside the cell or outside of it. The golgi can be separated into its two sides; the **cis face** and the **trans face**. The **cis face** sits on the side nearest to the endoplasmic reticulum and receives the packages of lipids and proteins being transported from the ER by the transport vesicles. Once inside the golgi, these proteins undergo further modification and have **phosphate groups added** as tags to be used later in order to device where each protein should end up. Finally, using these chemical tags, the modified proteins and lipids are sorted and packaged into another transport vesicle from the **trans face** of the golgi to be delivered to other parts of the cell such as the lysosomes.

### Lysosome
The **lysosome** acts as the cell's "garbage collectors" and works to break down old and unnecessary cell materials so that they can be repurposed by the cell and used again. These **acidic organelles** use digestive **hydrolytic enzymes** which break down large molecules such as complex proteins and carbohydrates into smaller molecules like basic amino acids and simple sugars. In other cases, the lysosome may ingest harmful bacteria so that it can be destroyed.

< Golgi Apparatus < > Vacuole >

### Vacuole
**Vacuoles** are large vesicles derived from the **endoplasmic reticulum** and **Golgi apparatus**. Vacuoles are an integral part of a cell's endomembrane system.

Vacuoles perform a variety of functions in different kinds of cells. In animal cells, vacuoles are small and help get rid of waste products. As food is digested, wastes are released when the vacuoles fuse with a specialized region of the plasma membrane that functions as an anal pore.

### Mitochondria
The **mitochondria** is the "powerhouse" of the cell! These organelles are hypothesized to have once been a self-sustaining prokaryotic cell which became an **endosymbiont** of the eukaryotic cell that is the animal cell, meaning both the mitochondrion and the eukaryotic cell found a **mutualistic relationship** as a result of the mitochondrion becoming part of the cell. Some cell types, such as red blood cells, contain no mitochondria while others, like liver cells, can have more than 2000! The function of these organelles are to supply the chemical energy needed to carry out cell functions, through the processing of adenosine triphosphate (ATP); a molecule with energy-dense phosphate groups. These "units" of ATP can then be used to power metabolic processes throughout the cell.

< Vacuole < > Peroxisome >

### Peroxisome
A peroxisome is an organelle found within the cytoplasm that play an important role in lipid metabolism. Very long chain fatty acids are broken down via beta oxidation into medium chain fatty acids, which are then shipped to the mitochondria to be broken down further into carbon dioxide and water.

### Centrosome
Many of the events of mitosis, which is the process in which a cell duplicates all of its contents, depend on the mitotic spindle. In animal cells, the assembly of spindle microtubules starts at the **Centrosome**, a subcellular region containing material that functions throughout the cell cycle to organize the cell's microtubules and is important during cell division. Each centrosome contains two **centrioles**.

### Centrioles
In animal cells, microtubules grow out from a **centrosome**, a region that is often located near the nucleus. These microtubules function as compression-resisting girders of the cytoskeleton. Within the centrosome is a pair of **centrioles**, each about 250nm in diameter. The two centrioles are at right angles to each other, and each is made up of nine sets of three microtubules. The blue portions of the centriole shown represent nontubulin proteins that connect the microtubule triplets. Centrosomes with centrioles help organize microtubule assembly in animal cells.

### Microtubule
**Microtubules** are one of three types of fibers that make up the **cytoskeleton**. They are shaped like hollow tubes and made up of proteins called **tubulins**. A tubulin protein also called a **dimer**, is made up of two different polypeptides: α-tubulin and β-tubulin. 

Microtubules can grow in length by adding tubulin dimers, and can also be dis-assembled and their tubulins used elsewhere to build other microtubules throughout the cell.

Overall their function is to serve as the backbone of the cell to help shape and support the cell. They also serve as tracks along which organelles equipped with motor proteins can move throughout the cell.

### Microfilaments
Like microtubules, microfilaments seem to be present in all eukaryotic cells. They are thinner, solid rods that play a structural role in bearing tension forces (pulling forces) in the cell. In essence they assist with cell movement and are built from molecules of **actin** a globular protein.

A three dimensional network formed by microfilaments just to the inside of the plasma membrane helps support the cell's shape. This network gives the outer cytoplasmic layer of a cell, called the **cortex**, the semisolid consistency of a gel, in contrast with the more fluid state of the interior **cytoplasm**.

### Intermediate Filaments
**Intermediate filaments** are named after their diameter, which is larger than the diameter of **microfilaments** but smaller than that of **microtubules**. They are made up of proteins called **keratins** which makes them more permanent structures than microfilaments and microtubules. Because of their sturdiness,Intermediate filaments play an important role in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing the position of certain organelles. For instance, the **nucleus** typically sits within a cage made of intermediate filaments.

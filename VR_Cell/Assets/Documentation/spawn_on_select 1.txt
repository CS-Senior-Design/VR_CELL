Steps to make it possible to spawn ora=ganelles by selecting them while they are inside the cell:

1) The parent that holds all the organelles should not have any rigid bodies or colliders or interactables

2) Add the following components to the organelle  you want to be able to select and spawn
    - Rigid Body (enable gravity and freeze both position and rotation)
    - Mesh Collider (enable the convex check box)
    - XR simple interactable

3) On the XR Simple interactable component add an interactable event for 'select entered'
    - Drag in the left hand controller (or whatever game object is holding the 'SpawnMenu' script)
    - Select the 'SpawnMenu.spawnOrganelle' function
    - Add the prefab for the model that you want to spawn

4) The prefab for the model you want to spawn has to have the following:
    - Rigid body (same as above)
    - Mesh collider (same as above)
    - XR Grab Interactable

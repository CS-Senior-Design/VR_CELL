How to get teleport working with Dpad Up:

1) Player parent object needs to have: 
	- The 'Input Handling' script attached
	- 2 right hand XRRayInteractors, 1 for teleporting and 1 for object interaction. Make sure they are each restricted to their proper layers.

2) In 'Input Handling' script, place the call to 'openTeleport()' method inside of the 'RightPrimary2DAxisUp()' method.
	- this will switch the XRRayInteractor to the teleporting one while you are holding up on the dpad/joystick.

3) In the same script, place a call to 'cancelTeleport()' inside of the 'RightPrimary2DAxisClickReleased()' method and the 'RightPrimary2DAxisHome()' method.
	- this will switch the XRRayInteractor to the normal one when you release the DPad or bring the joystick back to home position in the center.

4) In the same script, place a call to 'cancelTeleport()' inside of the 'RightGripPressed()' method. 
	- this is just so that once you are in teleport mode, you have a binding to cancel it if you change your mind about teleporting.

5) For the actual teleporting part, click on the teleporting XRRayInteractor on the unity editor and select the following:
	-  Select Action 
		- Use reference = true (checked)
		- Reference = Custom Teleport/Select
	- Select Action Value
		- Use reference = true (checked)
		- Reference = Custom Teleport/Select Value

6) Lastly, make sure that the bindings are correct. 
	- Open the action map and go to the 'Custom Teleport' Action Map.
	- Select should be Action Type: Button with initial state checked
		- 2 bindings:
			- trackpadClicked [RightHand ViveController]
			- triggerPressed [RightHand XR Controller]
	- Select Value should be Action Type: Value with Control Type: Vector2
		- 1 binding: 
			- primary2DAxis [RightHand XR Controller]
				- Sector: North, allow reentry
